# Elysian
This is an [Obsidian]([https://obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)) theme inspired by the UI of [Disco Elysium](https://discoelysium.com/). It has custom embedded backgrounds, fonts and features tape-like markings that follow the content. It supports both dark and light color scheme.

# Notes
- This is my first theme and to be fair any kind of CSS work. I don't guarantee full functionality so please let me know if anything is broken or incompatible.
- It works best with readable line width turned on, I've added some margins to make sure it's usable but it is a worse experience in my opinion.
- I've failed to add it in pictures but the light theme has current line dimming, I've decided to not include it in dark theme for a cleaner experience.

# Plugins
Due to how it is renders the tape markers it may lead to some issues. I've already remade some parts of it since I saw buggy behavior on the [Kanban](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban) plugin. If that is the case, again do let me know.
